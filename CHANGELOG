20001102: (mailing list only)
>8 directions per entity now works properly.
Spelling errors fixed up, thanks to Jason Spence
Added events to the map format.
Changed common map loading code to make it more robust. TOPLEVEL and EVENT
layers are now optional, and will default to all empty if they are not present.
Added events and weapons to some maps.
Made changing levels work.

20001109:
The programs do not change directory, but instead use absolute paths.
Added more options to events (active, repeat, visible).
Clients entities now retain their weapons between levels.
Made some levels link up together to form some sort of a plot.
Game messages appear on client window.
Adjusted ai_face_target() to face closest target, not first one within range.
Can't pickup a weapon you already have in deathmatch.
Removed pickup weapon switch.
Added 16 direction BSD image.

20001109-2:
Found the segfaulting bug... I assumed some memory was empty after clearing it
with the sizeof the pointer rather than the size of memory it pointed to. One
little bloody asterisk :(

20001114:
Added powerups (tightarse tuesday, petrified natalie portman, bitrot, smp etc).
Adding ability for text to be written to the map. You can see this on
the new improved slashdot map.

20001115:
Made ai shooting guns work.
Improved the slashdot map drastically, though it still needs a lot of work.

20001120:
Added Game Objectives loadable from map.
Changed flamer and borg weapons, to make them easier.
Fixed client entities still active before client rejoined bug.
Map updates/changes.

20010107:
Improved classic controls (so they're actually usable now)
Fixed PATH_MAX not defined portability problem.

20010204:
Fixed unsigned frags value.
Removed BUNNYBASH mode, the same results can be gotten from setting the game
objective to ELIMINATE_CLASS and setting class to NEUTRAL.
Set "now" as global once at start of loop rather than lots of gettime() calls
in server.
Entity_type should be pointer in the entity structure rather than func call.
Preload entities going into the map.
Added protocol version number so that client and server speak the same language

20010308:
entity_dist() (by far the most often called function) uses integer operations rather than floating point ops (and is thus much faster) 
Milo's patch:
	New item, patent powerdown (can't use any weapons).
	Events that can trigger other events.
	Improved arctic.map
Events have become much more powerful. We now have doors, switches and other
things.
Made an introduction level, where the player can learn the game in safety. This
level also serves as an example of some of the things you can do with the new
event code.
Fixed bugs that occured when map size < screensize.
Re-indexed some tiles to decrease their size.

20010324:
Added a bio for entities that didn't already have one.
Fixed top level layer bug when map size < screensize.
Entities are sorted on the client so they are drawn in the correct order (based
on the y value of their bottoms)
Optimised: particle_update(), particle_draw(), from/to net.
Change events around a bit, but they are still a bit limited in what they can
do.
Added sewer level between Street and Skyscraper map (where you go down the
man hole).

20010508:
Message are properly buffered and printed (in colour) on client. Colors are:
GREEN, Messages from other clients
WHITE, Message from the server (client enters/leaves/dies).
RED, Message from an event.
New "loseweapons" event (lose all weapons & ammunition). 
Client "Kill me" message, frags and query frags Net Messages added.
Improved laggy key handling in menu and menu/game ESC toggle.
Events have 3/4 of a second between triggering now.
Improved "sewer" map
Fixed weapon switching annoyances.
Fixed touchdamage over a second rounding down error (bugs not hurting bug)
Redid most of the network code, everything is properly buffered now.
Added weapons, events & spawn points to "Tux 3:16" 
Client can query frags from the server.

20010519:
Fixed a few things in the "entities" file.
Demo ability. This is done by faking a network connection but reading from
a demo file rather than a socket. Check out "xtux -h" for command line switches
Made some demo's play if the menu is idle.
LONG_MAX should have been ULONG_MAX in client/particles.c

20010601:

Misc bug fixups - thanks Sam Hocevar
Added "follow pointer" mouse mode patch.
Save mouse buttons to ~/.xtux

TODO:

Fix race conditions when forking a server.

Milo's soul sucker code.

A greeting string for enemies to talk?

A very simple entity that doesn't move (accel
0) that spawns projectiles could be a turret, or if
you set it's reload time to very slow, it's projectile entity to a BADDIE
and vision to quite large, you could have generator like Gauntlet.

Pause at end of level for frag count.

Automake/configure install scripts for portability/ease of install.

Frags displayed nicely.

More documentation / code comments etc

Multilingual support.

Generic (ie not XTux specific) tile map editor (a todo once XTux is done)
