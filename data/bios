[TUX]
info_lines 3
Linux mascot by trade, Tux also dabbles in herring eating
and occasionally saving the world from evil monopolistic
Redmond-based software companies.

[TIE]
info_lines 1
Tux's nephew. Awwww, isn't he cute!

[GOWN]
info_lines 2
Tux's girlfriend. She's pink because all females wear pink.
At least that's what we're told, we're programmers, see :(

[BSD]
info_lines 6
The BSD Daemon, also known as "The Beastie". He usually
spends his time complaining about "That damn penguin who
has greater market share" or smugly smiling because his OS
is more obscure and thus somehow superior.
The Beastie lives for the day he can teach that cheeky
young penguin a thing or two about a REAL Unix.

[RMS]
info_lines 2
Bearded founder of the GNU project. This guy was coding
free software when Tux was just a twinkle in Linus' eye.

[LINUS]
info_lines 2
His stated goals are "World domination and scantly-clad
women." Surely a cause worth fighting for.

[SHADOWMAN]
info_lines 2
The mysterious Shadowman wears a Red Hat and has plenty
of freshly burnt CD's to throw around.

[GNOME]
info_lines 3
Building on the work of his friend Wilbur the Gimp, this
little fellow has quite a disliking for a particular green
dragon.

[SUSE]
info_lines 1
Geeko the lizard is Europe's Godzilla.

[GNU]
info_lines 3
The GNU, of the Emacs Hurd wanders around picking on
peoples' naming conventions, which he doesn't pronounce
correctly anyway, on account of his lisp.

[VI]
info_lines 2
He's a radical rat! No hands off the home-row!
:wq!

[DUKE]
info_lines 2
Some think he's as slow as fsck, some think the Sun(tm)
shines out of his a**

[KDE]
info_lines 3
This QT little Dragon looks (and feels) like a particular
desktop that almost everyone else here dislikes with a
passion. Expect a flamewar.

[BORG]
info_lines 2
I included this guy for Gerald Holmes. Perhaps he'll pull
himself away from Space Cadet for a while to play some XTux.

[TROLL]
info_lines 6
This guy is found under bridges muttering "Linux has no GUI"
and is dangerously obsessed with Natalie Portman and grits.
Trolls are inherently bad, but you Linux long-haired
communists that sit around reading HOWTO's all day rather
than getting any work done knew that already, didn't you?

[BUG]
info_lines 4
A product of Microsoft corporation. Usually comes free (as
in beer) and terminally integrated with most of their
software. Bugs are just one more thing which Microsoft has
a near monopoly on.

[CLIPPY]
info_lines 3
This robotic creature has two settings, "Evil Killing
Machine" and "F%$#cking annoying". Fortunately, the
paperclips you will see in XTux are stuck in Evil mode.

[BUNNY]
info_lines 3
Cute little furry wabbit. You shouldn't kill these
unless they attack first.
"AHH! HE'S COMING RIGHT FOR ME!!!"

[MSCP]
info_lines 2
A MicroSoft Certified Peon. Swapped his soul and a large
certification fee for instructions on how to think.

[ZOMBIE]
info_lines 1
Braaaaiinnnnssss.....

[COBOL]
info_lines 5
A hideous, hideous monster. Disgusting to look at, this
beast will rot your mind and wear down your fingers from
over-typing. Take weapon and point at COBOL. Pull trigger
spawning bullet, adding bullet to COBOL storing in COBOL.
Indent this you prick!

[FLAMER]
info_lines 2
Often falling victim to clever Trolls, this guy tends
to fire first and think later, if at all.

[DUCKBOY]
info_lines 2
This little guy isn't really good for anything other than
being shot into little pieces.

[CD]
info_lines 2
Fresh and piping hot from the CD burner, CD's are plentiful
but somewhat weak weapons.

[FIREBALL]
info_lines 1
May hot flaming death come quickly to your enemies.

[ROCKET_SMALL]
info_lines 3
Self-guiding rocket propelled explosive.
From my computer game experience, people just leave these
things lying around all over the place.

[CAN]
info_lines 2
Refreshing caffeine suspended in a cola solution.
Gives +15 health.

[DEWCAN]
info_lines 2
Hill Precipitate. Twice the caffeine of regular softdrink.
Gives +30 health.

[NODOZE]
info_lines 3
Staple of truckers and students, this chemical slap in the
face will keep you awake long past when it's good for you.
Restores full health.

[BADCAN]

Teams of mad scientists toiled for years in search of the
holy grail of evil overlords, caffeine free cola.
Consuming this toxin will cause you to lose 15 health. 

[PIZZABOX]
info_lines 1
A round meal in a square box. +20 health 

[RANDOM_POWERUP]
info_lines 1
Give a random powerup.

[TIGHTARSE]
info_lines 3
Each shot you fire while powered up has a 50% chance that it
will not use any ammunition. It's like all your Tuesdays
have come at once!

[BITROT]
info_lines 2
This powerup will begin a slow decay of your bits, which
is even more painful than it sounds.

[SMP]
info_lines 2
Installs a system patch to allow Symmetrical Multiprocessor
Support, which temporarily doubles your firing rate.

[FIREWALL]
info_lines 1
Installs a temporary firewall which absorbs 50% of damage.

[INVISIBLE]
info_lines 4
This powerup causes your character to become invisible to
other players and monsters. However, the technology still
has a few bugs, one of which is visible smoke trails while
moving.

[NATALIE]
info_lines 2
Beware her seductive looks. Close contact with Natalie
Portman is a known cause of petrification.

[E]
info_lines 3
Picking up an E (for Enlightenment) will allow you to
move with a 50% speed bonus, but beware. What goes up,
must come down.

[PATENT]
info_lines 4
This causes a court to put a temporary injunction on use of
devices that fall under contested patent 65535 (a device
by which a party blows away a second party). You are thus
unable to use any of your weapons except your default.

[CHAINGUN]
info_lines 4
The Chaingun uses the gatling gun principle of rotating
barrels. It's a destructive killing machine that will clear
the room. However, it has a healthy appetite for ammunition.

[SHOTGUN]

A twelve gauge double barreled Remington, S-Mart's

Michigan. Retails for about $109.95. It's got a walnut stock
cobalt blue steel and a hair trigger.
That's right. Shop Smart. Shop S-mart.
                      - Ash

Shoulder mounted rocket launcher. Rockets do not home in
on the shooter, but they can still do them damage.

The Railgun. Fires a depleted uranium pellet which stops for
nothing short of a solid wall. This includes whatever is
standing in it's path.
