The weapons file in the xtux data directory describes the weapon types found
in the game. The weapons file is parsed by function in the sourcecode file
src/common/weapon_type.c.

An weapon entry starts with the header of the weapons name enclosed in square
brackets, ie "[WHACKER]". All following values until another weapon name in
