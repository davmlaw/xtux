The entities file in the xtux data directory describes the entity types found
in the game. The entities file is parsed by functions in the sourcecode file
src/common/entity_type.c.

An entity entry starts with the header of the entity name enclosed in square
brackets, ie "[FRED]". All following values until another entity name in square
brackets are used to fill in details about FRED.

speed, height, width etc and also information on how it is drawn on the client.
